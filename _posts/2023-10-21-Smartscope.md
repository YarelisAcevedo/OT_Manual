# Smartscope: Laser Scanning Tool

* We use the Laser scanning tool to calculate changes in height along the bond pads on hybrids and sensors as well as to see if sensors have any bowing present (not perfectly flat). This is done as part of the final inspection for 2S and PSS modules and has recently been integrated into the visual inspection routine of new untested 2S and PSS sensors 

## Procedure
* First, turn on the controller for the smartscope microscope (press on switch)
* Run the Initialize software on the desktop
* Hit the start/stop button on the controller, engage - yes, stylus - none
* Run the Measuremind 3D multisensor software (click app above the initialize app)
    * Press start/stop, press no for probe stylus being installed
