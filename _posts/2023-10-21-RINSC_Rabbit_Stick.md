# RINSC Rabbit Stick Procedure 

* In the shared Google Drive, go to RINSC Irradiations
    * Create a new folder for the rabbit you are making, and copy the text file found inside the previous rabbit stick folder. Rename both this folder and the text file with the number of this round of irradiation 
        * In the text document, remove the previous diode names and measurements, leaving them blank for now
* To assemble a rabbit stick you will need the following: small plastic baggies, plastic tip tweezers, scissors, thin sharpie, thick sharpie, kapton tape, wooden rabbit stick, metric ruler, large plastic bag for holding rabbit stick (found in purple bag near freezer)
    * You cannot touch the rabbit stick or the diodes with your hands, you must wear latex-free gloves and an ESD bracelet when handling the diodes
* A rabbit stick is a long rectangular piece of wood (~6inx1in)
    * Face 1 = has a rectangular notch in the center
* Label each face at the top and bottom with its number (1 through 4 going right) Label the top end of the stick (facing the wall) with an F, for front, and the bottom end (facing you) with a B, for bottom/back 
    * Each stick has 10 pin diodes, 2 foils, 4 Dzero diodes, and 4 half moon diodes. 
    * The foils receive isotope analysis at the reactor, and are to be placed in the center of the rabbit stick faces on face 1 and 2 to increase accuracy
* The diodes will be arranged onto the rabbit stick as follows:


| F | F | F | F |
| - | - | - | - |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| Pin | Pin | Pin | Pin |
| HM | HM | HM | HM |
| Foil | Foil | Pin | Pin |
| D0 | D0 | D0 | D0|
| Pin | Pin | Pin | Pin |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| B | B | B | B |

or 

| F | F | F | F |
| - | - | - | - |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| Pin | Pin | Pin | Pin |
| HM | HM | HM | HM |
|    |    | HM | HM |
| Foil | Foil | Pin | Pin |
| D0 | D0 | D0 | D0|
| Pin | Pin | Pin | Pin |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| B | B | B | B |

 * 
     * Place the diodes in their respective baggies on the table in front of you in this order
 * On the empty plastic baggies, using the finepoint sharpie, write the names of 2 diodes in each bottom corner
     * Cut out an area big enough to hold the respective diode type from these baggies
    * Prepare multiple strips of kapton tape for taping these baggies shut later on
* On the empty plastic baggies, using the finepoint sharpie, write the names of 2 diodes in each bottom corner
    * Cut out an area big enough to hold the respective diode type from these baggies
    * Prepare multiple strips of kapton tape for taping these baggies shut later on
* Using a plastic tip tweezer, remove the diodes from their labeled bags and place them into their corresponding cut out plastic baggie
    * Tap the baggie shut using the kapton tape, and then place the diode back on top of its original bag to stay organized
* Cut out 6 pieces of kapton tape roughly the length of the rabbit stick
* Tape the diodes onto the rabbit stick, starting with the top and bottom diodes (pin diodes) on each face. Start at the front face and then tape your way right towards the 4th face 
    * Leave a little tab to easily pull the tape off after irradiation (specifically label this tab “Pull” on the foils since these are tested at the reactor)
    * Use two pieces of tape for the halfmoon diodes
    * Make sure the faces (stripe/diode side) of the diodes are facing outwards
    * Try to tape the diodes on as straight and centered as possible
    * Make sure the diode end of the HMs and the small diode end of the Dzeros are pointing towards the front end of the rabbit stick
* Take pictures of each face of the rabbit stick holding a metric ruler up to the side of the stick so that you can obtain measurements of diode locations later on. 
* Place the stick into the large plastic bag, and label this bag with the OT test number, Brown HEP, who made the stick, and the date the stick was made
    * Place this bag along with the original diode bags into the bottom right dry box in 550.
* The Blue dyed cornstarch puck will be attached to the front end of the rabbit stick at the reactor
